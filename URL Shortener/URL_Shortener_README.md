This is a Flask application that can be used to shorten URLs.

To run the application, first clone the repository to your local machine. Then, open a terminal window in the project directory and run the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The application will then be running on port 5000. You can access it in your browser by visiting the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5000/
```

The application has two pages:

* The home page allows you to enter a URL to shorten.
* The redirect page redirects you to the original URL.

The application uses the pyshorteners library to shorten URLs.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the application works:

1. The user enters a URL in the home page.
2. The application checks if the URL is valid.
3. If the URL is valid, the application shortens the URL using the pyshorteners library.
4. The application stores the shortened URL in a dictionary.
5. The application displays the shortened URL to the user.
6. The user clicks on the shortened URL.
7. The application redirects the user to the original URL.

I hope this helps!
